# Phasmophobia-Photo-Backup
-This utility will monitor your Phasmophobia game folder for new photos that you capture using the photo camera in game. 

-I've set the default game directory for you if you have it installed with steam on your C drive, but there is an option to choose an alternate directory. The program will check to make sure you chose the right place!

## Directions:
1. (Optional) Choose where the game is installed if it is not on your C drive.
2. Choose the folder where you would like images to be written to.
3. Once the game folder and backup locations have been selected: 
	- Click "Copy Photos" To manually copy the last 6 images that are in your game folder.
	- Click "Start" to begin automatically monitoring your game folder for new images, when a new one is detected, it will be copied to the backup folder automatically.
	- Click "Stop" to stop watching the game folder. (or just quit the application).
